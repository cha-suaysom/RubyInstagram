### Instagram-like website project

From the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE we implemented an instagram-like site on Ruby on Rails. 

The website allows user registration functionality from 'devise' gem, and the interface from 'bootstrap' gem.

The site allows user to signup with their emails, login and logout and allow them to post a picture along with the descriptions.

All pictures and their descriptions are posted on the front page.
